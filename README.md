# Map My Reps Data Command Line Tools
Shell scripts for updating the static data files used by [Map My Reps](https://github.com/tplorts/mapmyreps)

Warning: work in progress.  The scripts are lacking lots of helpful error checking, and
I have yet to add command-line requirements, either as a package.json or as a list
of global requirements listed in this README.
